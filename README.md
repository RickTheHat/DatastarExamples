## What is Datastar?

Datastar is a lightweight hypermedia framework that brings reactive functionality to server-rendered applications.

It combines the best of both worlds:
- The simplicity and reliability of server-side rendering
- The dynamic, reactive user experience of a (SPA) Single Page Application w/o the need for JavaScript
- Use JavaScript sparingly and only when you decide

## Why Use Datastar?

- **Minimal JavaScript**: Just include a single 14.5 KiB file - smaller than Alpine.js and Htmx combined
- **HATEOAS Compliant**: The only JavaScript you need is the library itself > no additional client-side code required
- **Server Technology Agnostic**: Write your backend in any language
- **Real-time Updates**: Utilizes server-sent events for fast, responsive experiences

## Benefits

- **Build Like a Pro, Code Like a Beginner**: Create sophisticated, reactive web applications without wrestling with complex state management or JavaScript frameworks
- **Real-Time Magic**: Update multiple parts of your page instantly - imagine a chat application where messages, user lists, and notifications all update in real-time without writing a single line of JavaScript
- **Your Server, Your Rules**: Keep all your business logic where it belongs - on the server. No more duplicating validation rules or business logic in JavaScript
- **Learn Once, Build Anything**: If you can build a traditional web page, you can build reactive applications. No need to learn Redux, React, or complex state management patterns
- **Instant Feedback**: Create responsive interfaces that feel like native apps - type in a search box and watch results filter instantly, all without complex client-side code
- **Focus on Features, Not Plumbing**: Spend your time building features users love instead of managing state, writing JavaScript, or debugging client-server communication
- **Say Goodbye to Full Page Refreshes**: The dreaded full page refresh is a thing of the past with Datastar - enjoy smooth, partial updates that keep your users in flow
